# Bluff is a two person game where each person tries to guess the numbers that
# the other will choose. Each player chooses 5 numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive.
# The final score is calculated as follows:
# Each person's starting score is the highest number that the other person did not pick;
# The reducer is the lowest number the other person didn't pick;
# The final score is the starting score - reducer.
# Example:
# Clara = [0, 1, 5, 9, 10]
# # starting score: 5
# # reducer: 1
# # pt: 4
# Marco = [0, 2, 8, 9, 10]
# # starting score: 8
# # Reduction: 2
# # individual score: 6
# # Winner: Marco
# Implement a function that receives a dictionary with the kicked names and
# numbers and returns the name of the winner. 
# input = {
#     'Clara': [0, 1, 5, 9, 10],
#     'Marco': [0, 2, 8, 9, 10]
# }
# output: 'Marco'
